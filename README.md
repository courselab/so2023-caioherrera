## Bare Metal Hello World
**a) Implement your own version of the hello world program in machine code.**

    Edit the file hw.hex using `syseg/eg/hw/eg-00.hex` as reference.
    Avoid copying and pasting the code, though. Try to recreate it from
    your knowledge of x86 real-mode and legacy boot mechanism.

    Edit the Makefile to build hw-hex.bin.

    Test your code using the emulator.

    If it works, try booting it on your physical hardware.

       Note:

       You may need to add some extra code to satisfy idiosyncratic BIOSes.
       Consult the examples in `syseg/eg/hw`

**b) Implement your own version of the hello world program in AT&T assembly.**

    Edit the hw.S using `syseg/eg/hw/eg-03.S` as reference.

    Repeat the tests mentioned in part (a).

**c) Implement your own version of the hello world program in C.**

    Edit the file hw.c using `syseg/eg/hw/eg-08.c` as reference.

    Repeat the tests mentioned in part (a)
